# ARDUINO-PID-CONTROL
With the capture of a signal in an RC circuit, I carried out the study for a PID control through the simulink and matlab interface
so in the attached files there is the entire process of control from the discrete signal to the simulation of the control through the arduino
it was used two resistors and two capacitors, the first resistor that does the filtering is 100k ohms and in series with a resistor of 220k ohms
at the end of the terminal of the second resistor is a 1uF capacitor and between the resistors is a 100u F capacitor . for simulation of each step
just remove the command for comments.
